# Reversi Bot
This is my entry to the [HackerEarth Battle of Bots 5 competition](https://www.hackerearth.com/battle-of-bots-5/multiplayer/reversi/) (requires login).

## Objective
Create a bot that will compete in the game Reversi. Problem statement can be found [here](../master/problem.md).

## How To
To run the bot, just run main.py and input a 10x10 board as described in the problem statement.  The script will output the coordinates of the move it would like to make.

## Results
My bot placed 14th in the competition.
